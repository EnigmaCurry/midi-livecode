# Introduction

isobar is a Python library for expressing and constructing musical patterns, designed for use in algorithmic composition. It allows for concise construction, manipulation and transposition of sequences, supporting scalar operations on lazy patterns.

Output can be sent via MIDI, OSC or SocketIO, or written to a .mid file. Input (for interactive systems) can be taken via MIDI, and patterns can be read from a .mid file.

Timing can be synchronised with an external MIDI clock, or generated internally. For fluid control over timings, the internal clock can also be warped by patterns subclassing the `PWarp` class; for example, a `PWRallantando` can be used to generate a gradual, exponential decrease in tempo.

Classes are included for some fairly sophisticated operations. `PLSys` can be used to generate patterns based on the formal grammars of [Lindenmayer Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system); `PMarkov` generates first-order Markov chains, accompanied by `MarkovLearner` to build a statistical model from an input pattern (or MIDI input). Numerous pattern generators for chance operations are defined in [pattern/chance.py](isobar/pattern/chance.py).

Most of the major parts of isobar are subclasses of `Pattern`, which implement's Python's iterator protocol. The `next()` method is called to generate the subsequent item in a pattern, with the `StopIteration` exception raised when a pattern is exhausted. Builtins such as `list()`, `sorted()` and `itertools` can thus be used to process the output of a `Pattern`.

# Usage

```python
from isobar import *

# create a repeating sequence with scalar transposition:
# [ 36, 38, 43, 39, ... ]
a = PSeq([ 0, 2, 7, 3 ]) + 36

# apply pattern-wise transposition
# [ 36, 50, 43, 51, ... ]
a = a + PSeq([ 0, 12 ])

# create a geometric chromatic series, repeated back and forth
b = PSeries(0, 1, 12) + 72
b = PPingPong(b)
b = PLoop(b)

# create an velocity series, with emphasis every 4th note,
# plus a random walk to create gradual dynamic changes
amp = PSeq([ 50, 35, 25, 35 ]) + PBrown(0, 1, -20, 20)

# a Timeline schedules events at a given BPM.
# by default, send these over the first MIDI output.
timeline = Timeline(120)

# assign each of our Patterns to particular properties
timeline.sched({ 'note': a, 'dur': 1, 'gate': 2 })
timeline.sched({ 'note': b, 'dur': 0.25, 'amp': amp })

timeline.run()

```

## Background

isobar was first designed for the generative sound installation [Variable 4](http://www.variable4.org.uk), in which it was used to generate musical structures in response to changing weather conditions. It was more recently used as the backbone of [The Listening Machine](http://www.thelisteningmachine.org/), taking live input from Twitter and generating musical output from language patterns, streamed live over the internet.

Many of the concepts behind Pattern and its subclasses are inspired by the excellent pattern library of the [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sf.net) synthesis language.
